# smallsh

In this assignment you will write smallsh your own shell in C. smallsh will implement a subset of features of well-known shells, such as bash. Your program will

1) Provide a prompt for running commands
2) Handle blank lines and comments, which are lines beginning with the # character
3) Provide expansion for the variable $$
4) Execute 3 commands exit, cd, and status via code built into the shell
5) Execute other commands by creating new processes using a function from the exec family of functions
6) Support input and output redirection
7) Support running commands in foreground and background processes
8) Implement custom handlers for 2 signals, SIGINT and SIGTSTP

To compile just use "make"
